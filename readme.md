### My honest and humble approach to Genaury :) ###
[Genuary](https://genuary.art/)

Each folder is dedicated to one of the Genaury's prompts. As Genaury itself suggests, I'm not going to try every prompt, only the ones that inspire my creativity the most.

> [!NOTE]
> Every prompt comes with build in p5.js libraries (cdns are not use either). Therefore there is no need to configure the enviroment in order to try the code. Simply run a local server and open the html.
